I am studying for a master's degree in the *Department of Computational Science & Technology, Seoul National University, Korea.*

## Interest

I'm interested in **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Data Science**.    
Recently, I'm studying ***Graph Neural Network(GNN)*** for my next research work.    
This blog aims to document my study works and share the materials that I make or have.    
I'm going to study some textbooks one step at a time though it takes long time.    

- *"Graphs and Matrice." Ravindra B. Bapat.*
- *"The Elements of Statistical Learning." Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman*
- *"Large-scale Convex Optimization via Monotone Operator." Ernest K. Ryu, Wotao Yin*

## Work Experience & Project

I was a mechanical engineer for three years in *Air Force* as an officer and another three years in *Samsung Electronics*. What I developed and researched were all about Thermodynamics, (Computational) Fluid Dynamics, and Materials.    
Now, as a graduate student and deep learning researcher, I'm responsible for several projects about Computer Vision work such as image classification, object detection and tracking, segmentation.    
Also, I'm a lecturer teaching international students Fundamental Python programming & Data analysis.

## Activity

- I was a drummer of my band when I was an undergraduate student, but I still love music and want to get into some instruments. (Please recommend any)    
- I like any outdoor activities, like hiking or riding a bike. These days I'd love to play tennis.     
- I was a vice president of the student council, Korea Aerospace University, 2013.
